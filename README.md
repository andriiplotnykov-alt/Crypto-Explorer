## 🏴‍☠️ CryptoExplorer: The Anti-Burnout OS

Most people quit crypto in 6 months because the noise is too loud. We’re building the world’s first **"Alpha-as-a-Service" platform**—merging on-chain intelligence with deep-psychology gamification to make "staying in the game" sustainable .

**🛠️ The Current Build (React/Zustand + Firebase)**
The foundation is live: `HustleEngine` (API orchestration), `AlphaService` (data normalization), and `CryptoTree` (node-based organization).

**🚀 The Mission (Where you come in)**
I’m looking for a **co-dev** to help on doubling efforts and output, turing this into a global platform.

Project features to come: 
* **The $CHIPS Economy:** Off-chain "Inner Coin" minting.
* **Social Architecture:** User-led alpha pipelines and rankings.
* **Progress Dashboards:** UI that tracks personal growth, not just price charts.

**🤝 The Collab**
This is a **bootstrap-to-moon partnership**. High autonomy and a chance to co-own a project. 

Feel free to reach out if the idea is good for you:
